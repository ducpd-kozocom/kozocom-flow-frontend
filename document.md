## 📖 Executive Summary
**KozoFlow** is an AI-powered platform designed to solve the communication and resource allocation bottlenecks in cross-border environments (Vietnam-Japan).

Unlike traditional tools that only record meetings, KozoFlow acts as a **Unified Intelligence System**. It "listens" to meetings to identify business needs (e.g., *"We need a React dev"*) and instantly connects with the internal CV database to suggest suitable candidates, bridging the gap between **Discussion** and **Action**.

### 💡 Business Value (Shark Tank Pitch)
* **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces meeting documentation time by ~90% (saving approx. 2 hours/employee/week).
* **Active Automation:** Converts passive meeting conversations into active resource hiring/allocation tasks.
* **Scalability:** Centralizes isolated company data (Audio, Text, CVs) into one accessible "Brain".
